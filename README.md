# NYC CitiBike Analysis

## Overview of Project

In order to help convince investors to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa,
data from a bike sharing service from New York City was analyzed. Tableau was used to perform
the analysis. In Tableau charts, graphs and other visualizations were made to help tell the story
of the data to the investors. Python and pandas were used to convert dates in the data from
integers to date time data types. This helped to conduct better analysis and create visualizations.
