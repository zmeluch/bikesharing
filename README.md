# NYC CitiBike Analysis

## Overview of Project

In order to help convince investors to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa,
data from a bike sharing service from New York City was analyzed. Tableau was used to perform
the analysis. In Tableau charts, graphs and other visualizations were made to help tell the story
of the data to the investors. Python and pandas were used to convert dates in the data from
integers to date time data types. This helped to conduct better analysis and create visualizations.

This heat map shows the number of trips taken by hour per weekday and then is broken down by gender and type of user. Subscribers account for 
more trips then customers. But male subscribers account for considerably more trips then any other category.

## Summary
The analysis of the NYC CitiBike data shows most trips last between 1 to 20 minutes. Also during the hours of 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm, during weekday, there
is an increase in number of trips. These trends continue when broken down by gender. Also when broken down by customer and subscriber, the subscriber is 
has increases in trips during the week and the customer increases on the weekend. The number of trips for subscribers is much greater than that of customers.
And male users make up the majority of users and account for the most trips. From this data it looks like many subscribers use the service to commute to work
during the weekdays which accounts for the majority of trips.

### Additional Visualizations
- Another visualization that would help investors is a graph number of trips by age of user broken down by gender.
- A second visualization that could help investor is a graph showing the number of users by age broken down by customer and subscriber.
